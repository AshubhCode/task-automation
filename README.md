This repository contains a Node.js script for task automation and an associated HTML and CSS implementation for a simple form.

# Task Automation (Node.js Script)<br>
# Prerequisites<br>
* Node.js installed on your machine.<br>
# Setup Instructions<br>
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.<br>

*> Prints the content of "concatenated.txt" to the console.<br>
*> Deletes "file1.txt," "file2.txt," and "file3.txt" from the directory.<br>

## HTML and CSS Implementation<br>
# Files<br>
* `index.html`: HTML file with a simple form.<br>
* `style.css:` CSS file for styling the form.<br>
  
# Form Styling<br>
The HTML form is styled using the "style.css" file to make it visually appealing.<br>

## DOM Manipulation with JavaScript<br>
# Files<br>
* `script.js`: JavaScript file for DOM manipulation.<br>
# What the JavaScript Does<br>
Appends the entered text from each field to a new paragraph in a "result" div on form submission.
Styles the appended paragraph dynamically (e.g., different colors for each paragraph).<br>
